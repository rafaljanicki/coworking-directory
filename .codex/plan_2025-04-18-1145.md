# Plan - 2025-04-18 11:45

- [x] Expose `VITE_API_KEY` to the frontend by exporting `API_KEY` in `client/src/lib/config.ts`.
- [x] Modify `apiRequest` in `client/src/lib/queryClient.ts` to include the `x-api-key` header when `API_KEY` is set.
- [x] Update `useSpaces.ts` to attach the API key header on fetch calls.
- [x] Update README.md with instructions for providing `VITE_API_KEY` during development (`npm run dev`) and production builds (`npm run build`).
- [x] Update CHANGELOG.md with frontend API key support details.
- [ ] Test in development mode to ensure API key header is included and API returns data only with valid key.
- [x] Create GitHub Actions workflow for deployment of backend and frontend.
